# Shared Module

The shared module contains classes and resources which are used in more
than one dynamically loaded module. By always loading with the
application the shared components are ready whenever a module requests
them.

This module is based of the structure which `angular-folder-structure`
recommends. For more information see the
[documentation](https://angular-folder-structure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared.html).
